# [ FASPO ] project

This organization serves as a home for the FASPO project, which is a concept of banking application that is used
to score the creditworthiness of certain customers. Entire codebase is made up from several microservices, that are
located in individual repositories. All code should be used only for educational purposes as it contains completely
made up business logic that only simulates real world banking application. The project is not intended to be used in 
production AS-IS.
